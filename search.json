However, HR can difficult interpret, especially proportional hazards assumption violated Zhang Schaubel (2024). cases, estimated HR becomes weighted average depends study’s specific censoring pattern, making difficult compare results across trials (Wang Schaubel 2018). Restricted Mean Survival Time (RMST) emerged robust clinically intuitive alternative, conclusion supported growing body literature advocates use design analysis clinical trials Uno et al. (2014). RMST average event-free time pre-specified time point, τ\\tau , estimated area survival curve. provides direct measure survival benefit units time (e.g., “days” “months”), often meaningful clinicians patients. Instead estimating RMST indirectly survival function, recent methodological advances focused modeling RMST directly function covariates. foundational paper (Tian, Zhao, Wei 2014) established class models using Inverse Probability Censoring Weighting (IPCW), provided theoretical basis direct RMST regression. Since , literature rapidly expanded adapt direct modeling approach complex data structures seen modern trials. Research moved beyond single timepoint modeling entire RMST curve function restriction time Zhong Schaubel (2022). Furthermore, handle common challenge adjusting high-dimensional categorical variables like clinical centers, computationally efficient stratified models developed, including multiplicative model (Wang et al. 2019) complementary additive model (Zhang Schaubel 2024). observational data, methods extended estimate causal effects (Ni, Lin, Lu 2021), settings competing risks, transplantation studies, (Wang Schaubel 2018) developed framework handle dependent censoring using cause-specific weights. date, computational implementation sophisticated methods focused primarily estimation. instance, original papers describe estimation can achieved custom-coded procedures cleverly manipulating standard software weighted least squares Cox regression Zhang Schaubel (2024). However, significant gap theoretical estimation frameworks availability validated, user-friendly tools study design. Calculating required sample size statistical power trial based advanced RMST models complex task , now, require bespoke simulation programming trial statisticians. package, RMSTdesign, designed fill critical gap. primary goal RMSTdesign provide trialists comprehensive accessible suite tools power sample size calculations based latest direct RMST methodology. operationalizes seminal work direct RMST modeling set validated functions, allowing researchers robustly design trials wide variety scenarios. RMSTdesign provides comprehensive framework implementing several key methodologies statistical literature: RMSTdesign provides comprehensive framework implementing several key methodologies statistical literature: Direct Linear Models: Based seminal work (Tian, Zhao, Wei 2014), functions model RMST directly using Inverse Probability Censoring Weighting (IPCW). Stratified Models: studies nuisance categorical variables (e.g., clinical centers), provide functions additive (Zhang Schaubel 2024) multiplicative ((Wang et al. 2019)) models, efficiently handle stratification without estimating parameters level. Dependent Censoring Models: settings competing risks, transplantation studies receiving organ dependently censors death, implement methods (Wang et al. 2019).
