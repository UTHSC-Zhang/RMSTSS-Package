\usage{

  pilot_data,
  time_var,

}
\value{
A function that takes \code{n_per_stratum} and runs the simulation.
}
\description{
This is a non-exported helper function that sets up and returns
another function responsible for running the core bootstrap simulation logic. This
factory pattern helps reduce code duplication between the public-facing
power and sample size functions. It prepares the model formula and pilot data
and returns the \code{run_power_sim} function which is then called repeatedly.
