\title{Power Calculation for Difference in RMST}
\usage{
RMSt.power(delta, sigma, n_total, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{delta}{Expected difference in RMST between treatment and control groups.}

\item{sigma}{Estimated common standard deviation of RMST.}

\item{n_total}{Total sample size (evenly split between groups).}

\item{alpha}{Type I error rate (default is 0.05).}
}
\value{
Power of the test (probability of rejecting null if true difference is `delta`)
}
\description{
Computes the power of a two-sample test comparing RMST between two groups,
assuming normal approximation.
}
\examples{
RMSt.power(delta = 1.2, sigma = 2, n_total = 100, alpha = 0.05)
}
